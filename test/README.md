# Test environments



This repository's tests and development automation tasks may in the future be organized using \[tox], a command-line CI frontend for Python projects.  tox is typically used during local development and is also invoked from this repository's GitHub Actions \[workflows](../.github/workflows/).



tox can be installed by running `pip install tox`.



tox is organized around various "environments," each of which is described below.  

(In the Future) To run \_all\_ test environments, run `tox` without any arguments:

```sh

$ tox

```
